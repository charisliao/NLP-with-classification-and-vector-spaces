# Description 

Welcome to the Vector Space Model section.     

In natural language processing, each word is representing as a vector consisting of numbers.
The vector encodes the meaning of the word. These numbers (or weights) for each word are learned using various machine
learning models, which will be explored in more detail later in this specialization. Rather than make you code the
machine learning models from scratch, we will show you how to use them. In the real world, you can always load the
trained word vectors, and you will almost never have to train them from scratch. In this project we will:    

- Predict analogies between words.
- Use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the word embeddings and plot them in two dimensions.
- Compare word embeddings by using a similarity measure (the cosine similarity).
- Understand how these vector space models work.    

All code and results could be found in [vector-space-model.ipynb](./vector-space-model.ipynb).
