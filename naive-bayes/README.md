# Description 

Welcome to the na√Øve bayes section. We will be performing sentiment analysis using the Naive Bayes method. Specifically, we aim to: 

* Train a naive bayes model on a sentiment analysis task
* Test using your model
* Compute ratios of positive words to negative words
* Do some error analysis
* Predict on your own tweet     

All code and results could be found in `naive-bayes.ipynb`.
