# Description 

Welcome to the Machine Translation and Document Search section. In this section, I will be implementing my first machine translation system and see how locality sensitive hasing works. The following topics will be covered in the jupyter notebook: 

- **The word embeddings data for English and French words.**    
• Generate embedding and transform matrices.   

- **Translations**    
•  Translaion as linear transformation of embeddings.    
• Testing the translastion.     

- **LSH and document search**    
• Getting the document embeddings.    
• Look up tweets.    
• Finding the most similar tweets with LSH.    
• Getting the hash number for a vector.    
• Creating a hash table.    
• Creating all hash tables.    


All code and results could be found in [machine-translation.ipynb](./machine-translation.ipynb).
