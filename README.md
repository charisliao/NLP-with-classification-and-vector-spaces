# NLP-with-classification-and-vector-spaces

A repository dedicated for Natural Language Processing with classification and vector spaces (a course from Coursera @DeepLearning.AI).    

In this repository, I will be documenting down what I've learned from the course and projects. Projects completed can be found in sub-directories. See [Contents](#contents) below for more information.

Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression
----------------------------
### Goals: 
To be able to extract features from text into numerical vectors, then build a binary classifier for tweets using a logistic regression!     

Concepts:     
- Sentiment analysis
- Logistic regression
- Data pre-processing
- Calculating word frequencies
- Feature extraction
- Vocabulary creation
- Supervised learning       

Sentiment Analysis with Naïve Bayes
----------------------------
### Goals:
Learn the theory behind Bayes' rule for conditional probabilities, then apply it toward building a Naive Bayes tweet classifier!      

Concepts:     
- Error analysis
- Naive Bayes inference
- Log likelihood
- Laplacian smoothing
- conditional probabilities
- Bayes rule
- Sentiment analysis
- Vocabulary creation
- Supervised learning

Vector Space Model
------------------
### Goals: 
Vector space models capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. The goal is to create word vectors that capture dependencies between words, then visualize their relationships in two dimensions using PCA.

Concepts: 
- Covariance matrices
- Dimensionality reduction
- Principal component analysis
- Cosine similarity
- Euclidean distance
- Co-occurrence matrices
- Vector representations
- Vector space models
