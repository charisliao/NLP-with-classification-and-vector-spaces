# Description 

Welcome to the logistic regression section. In this directory, sentiment analysis using logistic regression on tweets will be performed. Then, error analysis will be employeed to check the accuracy of the classifier. The goal for this project is to : 

* Learn how to extract features for logistic regression given some text
* Implement logistic regression from scratch
* Apply logistic regression on a natural language processing task
* Test using your logistic regression
* Perform error analysis    

All code and results could be found in [logistic-regression.ipynb](./logistic-regression.ipynb). 

To summarize the result: 
The logistic regression model's accuracy is able to acheive 0.9950.
